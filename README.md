# CommandBar
My World of Warcraft AddOn, written for the Vanilla version of the game - more specifically the Elysium Project servers.

CommandBar is an addon for offsetting abilities into macros with algorithms for deciding combat sequences and outcome.
The AddOn also introduces a few ease of life improvements lacking from Vanilla WoW:
- Mount/dismount toggle.
- Automatic poison application.
- Intelligent auto-attacking and throwing.
- Some programmatic equipment swapping.
